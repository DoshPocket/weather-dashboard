# weather-dashboard
a weather dashboard to assist in planning trips

## Description

I built this funcitonal weather dashboard to practice my skills with linking a web application to an API. It allows the user to search for weather conditions in any city while maintaining a search history that can be cleared with a button by the user. It will give temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index for the city searched. It also displays a 5 day forecast with an image for each day. 

I learned how to scrutinize the results and data of a fetch in order to organize it for rendering to the user.
